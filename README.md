# Applying Data Science - Business Case Studies using SAS

Companion and Download Site for the SAS Press Book "Applying Data Science Business Case Studies Using SAS"
Gerhard Svolba

## Overview
This is the new SAS Press book of Gerhard Svolba. It contains 8 case studies in 28 practical chapters with business explainations, methodological considerations and lots of SAS Code.

Why you want to read this book:
* This book reflects the author's enthusiasm to use analytical and data science methods to solve business questions and to implement the solution using SAS.
* It shows you the benefits of analytics, how to gain more insight into your data, and how to make better decisions. In eight entertaining and real-world case studies, Svolba combines data science and advanced analytics with business questions, illustrating them with data and SAS code.
* Written for business analysts, statisticians, data miners, data scientists, and SAS programmers, Applying Data Science bridges the gap between high-level, business-focused books that skimp on the details and technical books that only show SAS code with no business context.

This book is written for a variety of different persona groups and profiles.
* Business Analysts and Business Experts: Businesspeople can review the examples and see what can be achieved with analytical methods. They get insight into the power of analytics and the additional findings that can be generated by these methods. They might not study the SAS implementation and the code in much detail. They would rather hand over the implementation examples to their data scientist to give them a quick start to apply the methods.
* Statisticians, Data Miners, Data Scientists, and Quantitative Experts: This group of people might be interested to see how analytical methods can be applied to real-world business questions. They learn how analytical methods that are established in a certain industry might be applied to other areas. They see practical situations and constraints that they can expect to encounter when they apply data science methods.
* SAS Programmers: The book contains a lot of SAS code, including SAS macros, SAS DATA step code for data preparation, SAS analytics procedures, and SAS graph procedures. In this code SAS programmers can find new ways to solve certain problems in SAS and transfer the solutions in these examples to their day-to-day problems


## Description

*Learn how to access analytics from SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS)
using Python and the SAS® Viya™ platform.*

SAS® Viya™: The Python Perspective is an introduction to using the
Python client on the SAS Viya platform. SAS Viya is a high-performance, 
fault-tolerant analytics architecture that can be deployed on both 
public and private cloud infrastructures. While SAS Viya can be used by 
various SAS applications, it also enables you to access analytic methods 
from SAS, Python, Lua, and Java, as well as through a REST interface 
using HTTP or HTTPS.

This book focuses on the perspective of SAS Viya from Python. SAS Viya 
is made up of multiple components. The central piece of this ecosystem 
is SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS). CAS is the cloud-based server 
that all clients communicate with to run analytical methods. The Python 
client is used to drive the CAS component directly using objects and 
constructs that are familiar to Python programmers.

Some knowledge of Python would be helpful before using this book;
however, there is an appendix that covers the features of Python that are 
used in the CAS Python client. Knowledge of CAS is not required to use 
this book. However, you will need to have a CAS server set up and 
running to execute the examples in this book.

With this book, you will learn how to:

* Install the required components for accessing CAS from Python
* Connect to CAS, load data, and run simple analyses
* Work with CAS using APIs familiar to Python users
* Learn about general CAS workflows and advanced features of the CAS Python client

SAS® Viya™: The Python Perspective covers topics that will be useful to
beginners as well as experienced CAS users. It includes examples from 
creating connections to CAS all the way to simple statistics and machine 
learning, but it is also useful as a desktop reference.
